```feat: Update Proxy configurations for enhanced network routing
Description:
```
##
This commit introduces significant updates to Proxy configurations, ensuring more flexible and efficient network request routing. The key changes include:

Addition of new Proxy addresses

New addresses have been added to improve connection reliability in regions with high network load.
These addresses were selected based on their availability and connection speed.
Optimization of existing Proxies

Outdated and slower Proxy addresses have been replaced with higher-performing alternatives.
Improved client-server interaction, reducing response time.
Enhanced security

Support for HTTPS protocols has been added to ensure data privacy.
All new Proxy addresses were vetted for compliance with security standards.
Automatic Proxy switching

Introduced functionality for automatic switching between Proxies in case of connection loss, ensuring uninterrupted service.
Why is this important?
These changes improve the application's performance and reliability under unstable network conditions, particularly during peak usage times. Users will experience faster and more secure interactions with the system, regardless of their geographical location.
##
###
Next Steps:
Testing: Conduct thorough connection testing in various regions.
Monitoring: Set up performance monitoring for the new Proxy addresses.
Documentation: Update the technical documentation for the team to reflect the new configurations.
